## 🚀 Features

- Support for 2D/3D video/image datasets (e.g. TIFF, AVI, GIF).
- Modular pipeline: detection → linking → refinement → analysis.
- Visualization of tracked trajectories.
- Statistical analysis: displacement, mean squared displacement (MSD), diffusion rates, dwell times, etc.
- Extensible API for integrating custom detection or linking algorithms.
