## Features

- Support for sequential iamge datasets (e.g. TIFF, AVI, GIF).
- Modular pipeline: detection → linking → tracking → analysis.
- Visualization of tracked trajectories.
- Statistical analysis: displacement, mean squared displacement (MSD) etc.
- Extensible API for integrating custom detection or linking algorithms.
